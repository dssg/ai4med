# Assignments

The goal here is to understand what types of patients get diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and explore if we can do early detection. 
You should start from the assignment from Day 7 where you counted patients with Diabetes, prescribed Metformin, and getting insulin.

## Questions
1. 1. What are some characteristics (demographics, other diagnosis, procedures, medications, any other history you can get in the data) of patients who have type 2 diabetes?
2.  - list at least 10 things that this group has in common
3. 2. How are these charactersitcs different for patients who don't have type 2 diabetes?
     - list at least 10 things that they don't have in common
   3. Now can you identify patients who have many/most of the characteristics you identified in question 1 but do not have type 2 diabetes in the data?
       - how many such patients can you identify?
       - how many of the characteristics do they have from the list you created in question 1?
  4. Of the patients you identify in question 3, could some of them have type 2 diabetes? why or why not?
